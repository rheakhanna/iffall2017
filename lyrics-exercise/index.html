		<h1><b><span class="name">Elevation</b></h1>
		<h2><b><span class="artist">U2</b></h2>


		<br><p>High, higher than the sun
		<br>You shoot me from a gun
		<br>I need you to elevate me here
		<br>At the corner of your lips
		<br>As the orbit of your hips
		<br>Eclipse, you elevate my soul</p>

		<p>I've lost all self-control
		<br>Been living like a mole
		<br>Now going down, excavation</p>
		
		<p><i>I and I in the sky
		<br>You make me feel like I can fly
		<br>So high, elevation</i></p>

		<p>A star lit up like a cigar
		<br>Strung out like a guitar
		<br>Maybe you could educate my mind
		<br>Explain all these controls
		<br>I can't sing but I've got soul
		<br>The goal is elevation</p>

		<p>A mole, living in a hole
		<br>Digging up my soul, now
		<br>Going down, excavation</p>
		
		<p><i>I and I in the sky
		<br>You make me feel like I can fly
		<br>So high, elevation</i></p>

		<p>Love, lift me up out of these blues
		<br>Won't you tell me something true
		<br>I believe in you</p>

		<p>A mole, living in a hole
		<br>Digging up my soul now
		<br>Going down, excavation</p>

		<p><i>I and I in the sky
		<br>You make me feel like I can fly
		<br>So high, elevation</i></p>

		<p><i>Elevation
		<br>Elevation
		<br>Elevation
		<br>Elevation</i></p>
