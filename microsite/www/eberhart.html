	 	<h1>Eberhart's <br> Classification</h1>
	 	<p class="one">
	 	Cryptozoologist George M. Eberhart classifies ten types of mystery animals under the cryptozoological umbrella: </p>
	 	<ul>
	 	<li> 1. Distribution anomalies (known animals reported outside their normal range, e.g. the anomalous big cats of the U.K.)</li><br>
	 	<li> 2. Undescribed, unusual, or outsized variations of known species (e.g. the giant anacondas reported from Amazonia or the spotted lions of East Africa)</li><br>
	 	<li> 3. Survivals of recently extinct species (e.g. the ivory-billed woodpecker presumed extinct c. 1960, the Tasmanian tiger (thylacine), declared extinct in 1936, or the Steller's sea cow presumed extinct c. 1768, all of which are occasionally claimed to have survived to the present)</li><br>
	 	<li> 4. Survivals of species known only from the fossil record into modern times (e.g. the mokele-mbembe of central Africa, sometimes described as a living dinosaur)</li><br>
	 	<li> 5. Lingerlings, or survivals of species known from the fossil record much later into historical times than currently thought (e.g. the woolly mammoth, presumed extinct c. 12,000 BCE but occasionally purported to have survived into later eras)</li><br>
	 	<li> 6. Animals not known from the fossil record but related to known species (e.g. the Andean wolf or the striped manta-ray reported by William Beebe in the 1930s)</li><br>
	 	<li> 7. Animals not known from the fossil record nor related to any known species (e.g. North America's Bigfoot or most sea serpents)</li><br>
	 	<li> 8. Mythical animals with a zoological basis (e.g. the griffin, partly inspired by dinosaur fossils of Central Asia)</li><br>
	 	<li> 9. Seemingly paranormal or supernatural entities with some animal-like characteristics (e.g. Mothman, black dogs, vampires or some fairies from folklore)</li><br>
	 	<li> 10. Known hoaxes or probable misidentifications (e.g. the jackalope, an antlered rabbit, a popular hoax in taxidermy)</li></ul><br>
	 	<br>
	 	<p class="two"> Additionally, Eberhart argues for six exclusions from classification as a cryptid: </p>
		
		<ul>
	 	<li> 1. Insignificance. <i><div class="quote">Cryptids must be big, weird, dangerous or significant to humans in some way.</i></div></li><br>
	 	<li> 2. Lack of controversy. <i><div class="quote">Someone needs to observe a mystery animal and someone else needs to discredit the sighting. Cryptozoologists function as interventionists between witnesses and skeptical scientists.</i></div></li><br>
	 	<li> 3. Erratics. <i><div class="quote">The out-of-place alligator […] that turns up in an odd spot, undoubtedly through human agency, is not a zoological mystery […] [I]f someone discovers a new species of alligator that lives only in sewers, that is a different matter.</i></div></li><br>
	 	<li> 4. Bizarre humans (e.g. zombies) </li>
	 	<li> 5. Angels or demons. <i><div class="quote"> […]the paranormal or supernatural is admitted only if it has an animal shape (a werewolf sighting, which might involve a real dog or wolf, or a mystery canid).</i></div></li><br>
	 	<li> Aliens. <i><div class="quote">[unless such extraterrestrials] arrived a long time ago and thus classify as residents.</i></div></li><br>
	 	</ul>
