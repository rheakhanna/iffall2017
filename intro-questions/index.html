			<li>One thing I hope to learn in this class is a basic grasp of web design, as I have no prior experience in the area and I think it's an extremely useful skill to have in today's digital age.</li>
			<li>I think designing for the screen will require a lot more attention to the technical and strategic aspects of the process as it is ultimately used by a user, and so user interaction is important and adds a different dimension to design.</li>
			<li><a href="https://pencilsofpromise.org/"> This is a website of a non-profit that builds schools in developing areas. I like the clean, organized, yet lively design of the website, through the use of color and different forms of media.</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse"> I feel Netflix is a website that effectively communicates information without presenting it an overhwleming way. Shows are well organized into categories that are easy to access through straightforward tabs and suggestion pages. </a></li>
			<li><a href="https://theculturetrip.com/"> The Culture Trip website works really well overall, as not only is it easy to manouver around the website's cateogies, it is well-organized, clear in communication and has an attractive, minimal design that draws focus on its content and media. </a></li>
