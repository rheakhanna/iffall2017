Feedback for Madeline Partner:
<ul>
<li>I'd pay attention to how the red text overlaps different parts of the image, since both the text and parts of the image are high contrast at certain places(like when the text flows over his face in the first mockup), making it hard to read.
<li>In the second mockup, I'd change the placement/angle of the first half of your text. Right now, its tilted so slightly and not enough to look intentional, even though I know you're aligning it to the water in the fish bowl. I'd just place the text on top of the image an dmaybe experiment with scale too. Since the hierarchy of your text in the second mockup is a little unclear (I read the bottom half before I read the first half).
<li> I'd also make sure to use high quality pictutres, or manipulate them in a way that looks intentionally blurred or softened rather than look like a low-quality, pixelated photo.
