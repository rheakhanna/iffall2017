    <p class="paragraph"> A human is a theatrical art experience by Society of Spectacle, a live entertainment storytelling brand founded by Simon Huck. This exhibition explores the future of fashion and examines the idea of modifying our bodies. “The future where self-expression isn't defined by what you put on your body, but how you change your body.” </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> I’m drawn to this because of it’s radical ideas and the intersection of so many kinds of media - theatre, art, music and fashion. Although I h will not make it to the exhibition, just their products, website and concept  provokes me to think deeper on the subject. </p>

   	<p class="paragraph"> Bruno Ferdinand’s website makes use of subtle site interactions such as changing color screens to enhance each portfolio piece so that users get a deeper feel of each project. I found this to be a really enjoyable experience and wanted to keep scrolling through. </p>

		<p class= "paragraph"> <b> What I've been reading </b></p>
		<p class="paragraph"> Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is about the history of Homo Sapiens and while dealing historical content the author provokes us to think about our current world, but adding his own commentary and cultural questions. It’s blowing my mind away and making me question <b> everything </b> around us - our ‘achievements’ in the physical world as well as our belief systems and collective notions. Design tends to influence how humans experience the world and this book gives a great insight on how and why humans navigate the world in the way they do - which in turn helps guide design solutions. </p>
		<p class="paragraph"> I've also been reading Compassion Inc. by Gautam Sinha which is all about ‘monastic materialism’ and bridging the corporate world to social issues around us.  </p>
		<p class="paragraph"> In addition to these books, I read an article that really struck me - Npr's article onthe design of classrooms and how that affects students’ learning experiences. It makes me reflect on my summer internship as i interned at an architecture studio that specializes in redesigning learning spaces. It is interesting since most classrooms have not been redesigned from when they were first built around 60 years ago and today, this has a bigger impact on a child’s learning outcome than you would imagine. </p>
